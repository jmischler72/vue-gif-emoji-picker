# What is My Lib?

<strong>This component library offers a set of two components: a GIF Picker and an Emoji Picker.</strong>

Both components were based on this repository [enzostvs/vue3-discordpicker](https://github.com/enzostvs/vue3-discordpicker)

- The GIF Picker component uses the Tenor API v2, allowing users to search and select GIFs. 

- The Emoji Picker component provides users with a wide array of emojis.
