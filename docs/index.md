# What is My Lib?

<strong>This component library offers a set of two components: a GIF Picker and an Emoji Picker.</strong>

The GIF Picker component seamlessly integrates with the Tenor API, allowing users to search and select GIFs
effortlessly. It includes an intuitive interface with a search bar and display area for quick and engaging GIF
exploration. 

On the other hand, the Emoji Picker component provides users with a wide array of expressive emojis,
enhancing communication within applications. 

Both components are designed to be easily integrated into Vue 3 projects,
providing a delightful user experience and adding expressive elements to any application.
